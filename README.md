This is a basic API needed to properly execute chat functionality in [chit-chat-ui](https://gitlab.com/william.andrade/chit-chat-ui).

## Usage Steps 

* First and foremost, install all dependencies in this repo by running `npm install`.
* To start the application, run `npm start`.
* That's it! head on over to the UI project and follow those steps to start chatting

## Functionality for Events

The API handles a few events from the client. They are: 
- An initial connection 
- Messages being sent from users
- Clients disconnection from the API 


## Resources
